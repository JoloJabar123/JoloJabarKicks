		<p><b>Kobe 5 Protro Bruce Lee
artial artist Bruce Lee practised Jeet Kune Do, the Chinese philosophy of fighting without fighting, translated as: "The Way of the Intercepting Fist". Kobe took major inspiration from Lee's style and mentality, learning to adapt and react to the split-second spontaneity of the game.


The Kobe 5 Protro 'Bruce Lee' remembers the masters with a release of the classic colourway from 2010. The black and yellow upper and red scratch marks nod to memorable elements from Lee's iconic career. Lower, sleeker and faster-looking than before, the Protro is fitted with a large, flexible Zoom Air unit, responsive foam and scaled-down traction for optimal court feel.</b></p>
